# Semantic Pixelator

Live Demo: https://demo.appsilon.ai/apps/pixelator/

Created as part of the Appsilon shiny.semantic 2020 competition, semantic pixelator is a fun way to explore semantic elements by creating different image compositions using loaders, icons and other UI elements from semantic/fomantic UI!

Upload your own picture or use the random button to start. You can then use the sidebar to refine different parameters such as the size of the generated grid, the base element type, and different color options.

After you find a composition that you like, you can use the palette generator to generate a color palette based on the result, as well as download both the current palette details and the generated composition.

Have fun!
